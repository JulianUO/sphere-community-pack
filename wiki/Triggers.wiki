*@AfterHit*<br>
It alters the damage done by a weapon. The difference between @Hit and this is that @AfterHit is triggered after the new combat system calculates the damage. This must be used to alter the damage if you are using combat system included in SCP.<br>
Default: Hitter<br>
SRC: Hitted<br>
ARGN1: damage<br>
ARGN2: weapon.<br>
An example of use:<br>
{{{
on=@afterhit
if <argn2> == <findid(i_attunement).tag0.weap> && <src> == <findid(i_attunement).link>
return <eval (<argn1> / 2)>
endif
}}}

<br>
*@SkillPreSelect*<br>
Fired before any skill check (included warmode) takes place. Note that this is only fired when the skill is called from a macro or from the skillmenu, the rest of the skills need to be intercepted on the object that starts the skill (example: t_container for lockpicking).<br>
Default: Player<br>
ARGN1: Skill Selected<br>
