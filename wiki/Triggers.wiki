*@AfterHit*<br>
It alters the damage done by a weapon. The difference between @Hit and this is that @AfterHit is triggered after the new combat system calculates the damage. This must be used to alter the damage if you are using combat system included in SCP. ARGN1 is damage, ARGN2 is weapon. An example of use:<br>
{{{
on=@afterhit
if <argn2> == <findid(i_attunement).tag0.weap> && <src> == <findid(i_attunement).link>
return <eval (<argn1> / 2)>
endif
}}}
